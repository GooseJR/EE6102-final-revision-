# Cyber Security Attacks and Defenses

## Password Attacks

### Types:
1. **Brute Force Attacks**
  - A method where attackers try every possible password combination
  - Most time-consuming but guaranteed to work eventually
  - Effectiveness depends on password complexity and computing power

2. **Dictionary Attacks**
  - Uses a pre-compiled list of likely passwords
  - More efficient than brute force for common passwords 
  - Less effective against complex, unique passwords

3. **Rainbow Table Attack**
  - Uses precomputed hashes to crack password hashes
  - Trading storage space for cracking speed
  - Highly effective against unsalted password hashes

### Password Cracking Time Calculation Examples:

1. **Example 1 (10-character password)**
  * Possible characters: 95 (printable ASCII)
  * Password length: 10 characters
  * Cracker speed: 6.4 million ops/sec ($$6.4 \times 10^6$$)
  * Total combinations: $$95^{10} \approx 6 \times 10^{19}$$
  * Time required = $$\frac{6 \times 10^{19}}{6.4 \times 10^6} \approx 300,000$$ years

2. **Example 2 (16-character password)**
  * Available characters: 102
  * Password length: 16 characters
  * Cracker speed: 400 million ops/sec
  * Total combinations: $$102^{16} \approx 1.37 \times 10^{32}$$
  * Time required = $$\frac{1.37 \times 10^{32}}{400 \times 10^6} \approx 108 \times 10^{14}$$ years

### Prevention Measures:
* Use strong alphanumeric passwords with special characters
* Avoid using the same password across multiple accounts
* Update passwords regularly (recommended every 90 days)
* Do not keep password hints openly accessible

Based on the cybersecurity context, let me explain the role of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) in cybersecurity.

# Role of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

## What is MFA?
Multi-Factor Authentication is a security system that requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a resource. It adds extra layers of security beyond just a password.

## Authentication Factors
MFA typically involves a combination of:

1. **Something You Know**
- Password
- PIN
- Security questions

2. **Something You Have**
- Mobile phone (for SMS codes)
- Security tokens
- Authentication apps

3. **Something You Are**
- Fingerprints
- Face recognition
- Voice recognition
- Retina scans

## Importance in Cybersecurity

1. **Enhanced Security**
- According to the slides, MFA blocks 99.9% of automated attacks
- Makes it significantly harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access
- Even if one factor is compromised, other factors keep the account secure

2. **Password Protection**
- Reduces the risk from weak or stolen passwords
- Protects against password-based attacks like:
  - Brute force attacks
  - Dictionary attacks
  - Password spraying
  - Credential stuffing

3. **Business Benefits**

- Helps meet compliance requirements
- Reduces risk of data breaches
- Provides audit trails of access attempts

4. **User Authentication Assurance**
- Verifies user identity with higher confidence
- Reduces risk of impersonation
- Helps prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised

## Best Practices for MFA Implementation

1. **Risk-Based Approach**
- Apply MFA based on risk level
- More sensitive resources require stronger authentication
- Consider user role and access level

2. **User Experience**
- Balance security with usability
- Provide clear instructions
- Offer backup authentication methods

3. **Regular Review**
- Monitor MFA effectiveness
- Update methods based on new threats
- Review and revise policies regularly

## Limitations and Considerations

1. **Implementation Challenges**
- Initial setup costs
- User training requirements
- Technical infrastructure needs

2. **Potential Issues**

# DoS

## 1. Denial of Service (DoS) & DDoS Attacks

### Basic Concepts
* **DoS**: Single source attack to overwhelm target
* **DDoS**: Multiple sources attack simultaneously
* Both aim to make services unavailable to legitimate users

### SYN Flood Attack
1. **Normal TCP Connection**
   * Client sends SYN
   * Server responds SYN-ACK
   * Client completes with ACK

2. **Attack Process**
   * Attacker sends many SYN packets
   * Server responds with SYN-ACK
   * Attacker never sends ACK
   * Server resources get exhausted

### Packet Calculations
For ICMP Echo Request (ping):

**500-byte packets:**
* 1.5 Mbps link: 375 packets/second
* 2 Mbps link: 500 packets/second
* 10 Mbps link: 2500 packets/second
* 100 Mbps link: 25000 packets/second

Formula: 
```
Packets/second = Link speed / (Packet size * 8)
```

### Impact Factors
1. **Packet Size**
   * Smaller packets = more packets/second
   * Larger packets = more bandwidth/packet
   * Impact depends on target's bottleneck

2. **Link Speed**
   * Higher speed = more packets possible
   * Affects attacker's ability to flood
   * Target's bandwidth determines success

## 2. DNS Flood Attack
* Floods DNS servers with requests
* Disrupts DNS resolution services
* Often uses IoT devices for bandwidth
* Requires distributed prevention system

## 3. Botnet in DDoS
* Network of compromised computers

# Secret Key Cryptography

## Core Concepts
- Uses single key for encryption and decryption
- Both sender and receiver share same secret key
- Examples: DES, 3DES, AES

## Advantages
- Fast computation and high data throughput
- Relatively short key lengths (128-bit considered very secure)
- Simpler algorithms
- Efficient for large amounts of data

## Disadvantages
- Key distribution challenge - needs secure channel to share key
- Key management issues with multiple users
- Both parties must protect the shared key
- Scalability problems in large networks

# Public Key Cryptography

## Core Concepts
- Uses two different but mathematically related keys
- Public key for encryption, private key for decryption
- Examples: RSA, Diffie-Hellman, El-Gamal

## Advantages
- Solves key distribution problem
- Enhanced security - private key never shared
- Enables digital signatures and authentication
- Better scalability in large networks
- Provides non-repudiation 

## Disadvantages 
- Much slower than symmetric encryption
- Requires longer key lengths for equivalent security
  - RSA needs 2048+ bits vs 128 bits for symmetric
- More complex algorithms and computationally intensive
- Higher processing overhead

## Practical Usage
Most modern systems use hybrid approach:
1. Public key encryption to securely exchange a session key
2. Session key then used with faster symmetric encryption for actual data
3. Combines advantages of both systems:
   - Speed of symmetric encryption
   - Secure key exchange of public key systems

This hybrid approach provides an optimal balance of security and performance for most applications.

# Hashing in Cybersecurity and Digital Systems

## Core Hashing Concepts
- One-way mathematical function producing fixed-length output
- Any input length → fixed output length
- Small changes in input create large changes in output
- Cannot be reversed ("one-way")
- Computationally infeasible to find two inputs with same hash ("collision resistance")

## Hashing vs Encryption
1. **Directionality**
   - Encryption: Two-way (can decrypt)
   - Hashing: One-way (cannot "de-hash")

2. **Output Length**
   - Encryption: Similar to input length
   - Hashing: Fixed length regardless of input

## Role in Digital Signatures
1. **Efficiency**
   - Hashes message to fixed-length digest
   - Signs digest instead of entire message
   - Significantly reduces computational overhead

2. **Security**
   - Ensures message integrity
   - Any changes invalidate hash
   - Combined with encryption for authentication

## Hashing in Blockchain/Cryptocurrency

1. **Bitcoin Mining**
   - Miners compute hashes repeatedly
   - Must find hash below target difficulty
   - Creates "proof of work"
   - Ensures network security through computational effort

2. **Blockchain Integrity**
   - Each block contains previous block's hash
   - Creates unbreakable chain
   - Any modification invalidates subsequent blocks

## Digital Signatures in Blockchain

1. **Transaction Authentication**
   - Signs transaction hash with private key
   - Anyone can verify using public key
   - Proves ownership of sending address

2. **Non-repudiation**
   - Signer cannot deny signing
   - Cryptographically bound to transaction
   - Permanent record on blockchain

## Digital Certificates
- Issued by Certificate Authority (CA)
- Contains:
  - Public key
  - Identity information
  - CA's digital signature
- Verifies authenticity of public keys
- Essential for PKI infrastructure

Commonly used hash functions:
- SHA-256 (Bitcoin)
- Keccak-256 (Ethereum)
- SHA-3 family
- (Note: MD5 and SHA-1 considered insecure)

# RSA Algorithm

## Key Generation Process
1. **Choose Two Large Primes** (p, q)
   - Product n = p × q (modulus)
   - Calculate φ(n) = (p-1)(q-1)

2. **Select Public Key (e)**
   - Must be coprime with φ(n)
   - 1 < e < φ(n)
   - Commonly used: 3, 65537

3. **Calculate Private Key (d)**
   - Multiplicative inverse of e modulo φ(n)
     - e × d ≡ 1 (mod φ(n)) i.e. (e × d)%φ(n)=1

## Example Calculation
```
p = 5, q = 11
n = 55
φ(n) = 40
e = 3 (coprime with 40)
d = 27 (3 × 27 = 81 ≡ 1 mod 40)
```

## Encryption/Decryption
- Encryption: C = M^e mod n
- Decryption: M = C^d mod n

## Security Foundation
- Based on difficulty of factoring large numbers
- Prime numbers > 1024 bits recommended
- Security strength proportional to key size

## Digital Signatures with RSA
1. **Signing**
   - S = M^d mod n (using private key)

2. **Verification**
   - M = S^e mod n (using public key)

# Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

## Core Algorithm
1. **Setup**
   - Agree on prime p and generator g
   - g must be primitive root modulo p

2. **Key Generation**
   - Alice: Choose private a, compute A = g^a mod p
   - Bob: Choose private b, compute B = g^b mod p

3. **Shared Key Computation**
   - Alice: K = B^a mod p
   - Bob: K = A^b mod p
   - Both arrive at g^(ab) mod p

## Example Calculation
```
p = 97, g = 5
Alice: a = 36, A = 5^36 mod 97 = 50
Bob: b = 58, B = 5^58 mod 97 = 44
Shared key:
Alice: 44^36 mod 97 = 75
Bob: 50^58 mod 97 = 75
```

## Security Features
- Private values never transmitted
- Computationally infeasible to determine private keys
- Based on discrete logarithm problem

## Ephemeral DH in TLS 1.3
- New keys generated per session
- Perfect forward secrecy
- Prevents compromise of past sessions
- More secure than static RSA
- Faster than RSA for key exchange

The problem of RSA key exchange in TLS is that if the private key is compromised, all recorded past sessions can be decrypted. EDH prevents this through perfect forward secrecy.

# Authentication vs Authorization

## Authentication
- Verifies who the user is
- Based on credentials (username/password, biometrics, tokens)
- Happens first in the security process
- Answers: "Are you who you claim to be?"
- Example: Logging into an email account

## Authorization 
- Determines what resources user can access
- Based on user's privileges and permissions
- Happens after authentication
- Answers: "What are you allowed to do?"
- Example: Access levels in a database

## Key Differences
1. **Purpose**
   - Authentication: Identity verification
   - Authorization: Access control

2. **Process Order**
   - Authentication comes first
   - Authorization follows

3. **Risk Impact**
   - Authentication failure: Access denied entirely
   - Authorization failure: Limited access granted 

## Unauthorized Authentication?
- No, a user cannot be properly authorized without first being authenticated
- Exception: Public resources that don't require authentication
- Authentication is prerequisite for meaningful authorization
- Without authentication, system cannot reliably enforce authorization rules

A secure system requires both authentication to verify identity and authorization to control access rights. These work together but serve distinct security purposes.

# SSL/TLS AND SET (WEB SECURITY) PROTOCOLS

## Differences, Properties, Advantages, Disadvantages

### **SSL/TLS**
- **Properties**:
  - Provides **privacy** through encryption.
  - **Server authentication** via digital certificates (e.g., X.509).
  - Optionally supports **client authentication**.
  - Commonly used with HTTP, email, and other TCP applications.

- **Advantages**:
  - Easy implementation due to integration with major web browsers and servers.
  - Backward compatibility (up to TLS 1.2).
  - Widely supported and deployed.

- **Disadvantages**:
  - Cannot authenticate users or merchants directly.
  - Vulnerable to misconfiguration (e.g., TLS 1.2 configurations).
  - Requires additional resources like certificates.

### **SET (Secure Electronic Transaction)**
- **Properties**:
  - Specifically designed for secure payment transactions.
  - Provides **authentication** for all parties (merchant, bank, customer).
  - Utilizes **message encryption** rather than channel encryption.

- **Advantages**:
  - Reduces risks of merchant fraud as financial details are shared with a **payment gateway** only.
  - Provides a robust mechanism for **irrefutability** using digital signatures.
  
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Requires specialized software at both merchant and consumer ends.
  - Limited adoption due to deployment complexity.

## SSL and TLS 1.3 Handshake Protocol

### **TLS 1.3 Handshake**:
1. **Client Hello**:
   - Client proposes supported cipher suites and sends its key share.
2. **Server Hello**:
   - Server selects the cipher suite, shares its key, and sends a digital certificate.
3. **Session Key Agreement**:
   - Using **Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (EDH)**, both parties compute a shared session key.
4. **Completion**:
   - Client authenticates the certificate, finalizes the key, and sends a "Finished" message.

### **Use of Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman**:
- Ensures that a new key pair is generated for each session.
- Provides **forward secrecy** by preventing decryption even if private keys are compromised later.

## Differences Between TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3

1. **Key Exchange**:
   - TLS 1.2: Supports RSA and Diffie-Hellman.
   - TLS 1.3: Removes RSA and relies on EDH exclusively.
   
2. **Handshake Simplification**:
   - TLS 1.3 reduces the number of handshake messages, improving speed.

3. **Encryption**:
   - TLS 1.2 supports older, less secure algorithms (e.g., SHA-1, RC4).
   - TLS 1.3 uses modern cryptographic algorithms only (e.g., AES-GCM, ChaCha20).

## Security and Efficiency Improvements in TLS 1.3

- **Forward Secrecy**:
  - EDH ensures session keys are ephemeral, reducing the risk of retrospective decryption.
- **Efficiency**:
  - Streamlined handshake reduces latency.
  - Simplified protocol minimizes configuration errors.

## Is RSA Used in TLS 1.3?

- **Purpose**:
  - RSA is only used for **signatures** in TLS 1.3 (e.g., during certificate verification).
  - It is not used for key exchange, enhancing security.

## Forward Secrecy in SSL/TLS Protocols

- **Concept**:
  - Ensures session keys are ephemeral and not derived from long-term private keys.
  - Prevents decryption of past communications if private keys are exposed.

- **Implementation in TLS 1.3**:
  - EDH ensures each session uses a unique key pair, resolving potential vulnerabilities in TLS 1.2.

## SET Protocol: Consumer and Merchant Authentication

1. **Digital Certificates**:
   - Both consumers and merchants are authenticated using certificates issued by trusted third parties.
2. **Message Encryption**:
   - Secures payment details during transmission.

## Why Did SSL/TLS Succeed Over SET?

1. **Ease of Use**:
   - SSL/TLS requires only **server-side** certificates, making deployment simpler.
   - SET demands specialized software for all parties.

2. **Adoption**:
   - SSL/TLS is compatible with all web browsers, while SET needed additional infrastructure.

3. **Cost**:
   - Lower cost of SSL/TLS certificates compared to the complexity of deploying SET.

4. **Focus**:
   - SSL/TLS secures connections, while SET focused solely on transactions.

I'll help organize the content from the slides into a comprehensive document addressing these questions about blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, and DeFi.
